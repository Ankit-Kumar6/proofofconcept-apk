# Proof of Concept APK

This APK was developed as a learning project to explore Android app development. The app includes several features:

- **Counter Logic**: A simple counter that increments each time a button is clicked.
- **Send Intent**: When specific conditions are met, the app triggers a send intent that redirects the user to a link.
- **Receive Intent**: The app can receive shared plain text from other apps, displaying the text within the interface.

This project helped me to learn the basics of using intents, activity navigation, and creating simple user interactions in Android development.
